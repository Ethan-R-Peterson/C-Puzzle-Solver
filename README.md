# Puzzle-Solver-C++

C++ program that validates and solves 2D/3D maze puzzles using BFS and DFS, with support for command-line options and multiple output modes.
This project is a C++ puzzle solver designed to tackle complex 2D and 3D maze levels. The program validates input maps, detects solvability, and reconstructs solutions if they exist. It supports flexible command-line options, outputs either full map views or coordinate lists, and leverages both BFS (queue-based) and DFS (stack-based) search strategies.

Key features include:

Efficient storage with custom data structures (std::vector, std::deque)

Input validation and detailed error handling (std::cin, std::cout, std::cerr)

Command-line parsing with getopt_long()

Multiple output modes for solution visualization

This project demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving, data structure design, and practical systems programming techniques in C++.
